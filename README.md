This project examines the assications between women's educational attainment and intimate partner violence in Mexcio for my Master's thesis. This project is titled, "The Case of Mexico: Women's Educational Attainment Impact on Intimate Partner Violence". I uses STATA 17 to analyze a publicly available data source for my Master's thesis ([
](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/endireh/2021/#documentacion). I use a national household survey from Mexico called the 2021 National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships (Encuesta Nacional sobre Dinámica de las Relaciones en los Hogares) conducted by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).
This is the most up-to-date survey in Mexico and consists of a cross-sectional survey that asks heterosexual women who are 15 years old and older who are currently or formally married, partnered, widowed, divorced, or separated about their experiences with intimate partner violence.  
The analytical sample comprises 89,780 women who have been victims of intimate partner violence either recently or in the past. I use ordinal logistic regression models to test the associations between women’s educational attainment and physical, sexual, and verbal violence. 
My findings indicate that women’s educational attainment and intimate partner violence are strongly negatively associated and highlight that as women increase their educational attainment, intimate partner violence decreases.
