](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/endireh/2021/#documentacion). This data source is conducted by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). This data source provides infomration about women who are 15 years and older who currently or formerly experinced intimate partner violence. 
In my analyses, I use ordinal logistic regression models to analyze how women's educational attainment influneces intimate partner violence outcomes. Specifically, I analyze who women's educational attainment influneces physical, sexual, and verbal violence outcomes by creating base, control, and full models of my analyses.
